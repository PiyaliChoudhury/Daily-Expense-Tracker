# Daily Expensive Tracker 

## Overview
The Daily Expense Tracker is a project designed to help users keep track of their daily spending using a combination of Java, JavaScript, and a relational database. Hereâ€™s an overview:
The tracker includes features such as user authentication for secure logins, the ability to add, edit, and delete expenses, and the option to organize expenses by categories like food, transport, and utilities. It also includes data visualization, showing users charts and graphs to help them understand their spending patterns. Users can search and filter expenses by date, category, or tags, and the interface is built to be responsive, ensuring a good experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
The project uses Java (Spring Boot) for backend services, JavaScript for the interactive frontend, and a database like MySQL or PostgreSQL for storing data. For connecting to the database, JDBC is used, and for creating visual representations of data, tools like Chart.js may be employed.
The structure of the project is divided into backend components for handling requests and business logic, and frontend components for user interface functionality. The database schema is designed with tables that store users, their expenses, and categories, linked together by relationships.
To run the project, you would clone the repository, set up the database, and run the backend server with Maven or Gradle. The frontend can be served alongside the backend or through a separate server.
Enables users to monitor their financial habits, track previous transactions, and visualize monthly financial data using charts.
